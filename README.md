# Go-Forth

## A rough sketch of the primary concepts:

- ## Elements
  - The basic building blocks and items used in trade.
  - Elements can be combined to create new elements similar to Minecraft crafting.
  - Elements are grouped into categories.
  - E.G.
    - Animals => Pig, Cow, Cat, Worm, Bird
    - Plants => Grass, Tree, Flower, Fruit
    - Technology => Wheel, House, Plow
- ## Farms
  - Where elements are generated.
  - These can take the form of multiple bioms and may have different mechanics for gathering elements.
- ## Career
  - A player may decide to focus on improving a particular category of element and at the peak of their career gain access to one or more better recipies.
- ## Player Progression
  - The player's character has a life span at the end of which the progression makes a step forward; a new phase.
  - For each life span, the player must choose one of the following for their current character.
    - **Heir** : Will receive all the current character's farms at the start of the next phase. But not their recipies or inventory.
    - **Apprentice** : Will receive all the current character's recipies at the start of the next phase but not their inventory or farms.
    - **Beneficiary** : Will receive all the current character's inventory at the start of the next phase but not their recipies or farms.
- ## Estate
  - Where the player can manage their farms.
    - Increase the rate of replenishment of a particular element on a farm.
    - Increase the quality of an element being produced on a particular farm.
    - Create a new farm.
    - Retire a farm for profit.
    - Open a farm for other players to visit and recieve a share of the harvest.
  - Where a player can see the history of their progression.
  - Make descisions on what progression option to choose for the end of the current character's phase: Heir, Apprentice, Beneficiary.
- ## Market
  - Where inventory can be traded with other players.
  - Where players can see other player's progression.
  - Where players can chat.
